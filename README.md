# Sandbox

**Important:** We use the sandbox as working area as well as a place to host skills and code samples that are not actively maintained by the Misty team. Some of these skills require external hardware, and a handful may reference deprecated API commands. We believe hosting the contents of this repository helps to spark creativity and provides unique skill examples that we don't want to keep hidden. Some things might not work on the first try, so do proceed with care, and don't hesitate to ask questions in the [Misty Community Forums](https://community.mistyrobotics.com)

To run these examples, you'll first need to use the green __Clone or download__ button on the [Sandbox](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Sandbox) to copy the files onto your desktop. This will also ensure that you have the **Tools** directory in the same folder as the code samples, some of which need this directory to run. There will be a README in each directory with any specific instructions or notes required to execute the code posted there.
