# Sandbox

To run these examples, you'll first need to use the green __Clone or download__ button on the [Sandbox](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Sandbox) to copy the files onto your desktop. This will also ensure that you have the **Tools** directory in the same folder as the code samples, some of which need this directory to run. There will be a README in each directory with any specific instructions or notes required to execute the code posted there. 

IMPORTANT: We use the sandbox as working area as well as a place to reference older code. Some things might not work, so proceed with care and don't hesitate to ask questions in our [Community Forums](https://community.mistyrobotics.com)
